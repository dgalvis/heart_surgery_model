par_choices_acth_cort_double_original.mat - This is the latin hypercube that was extracted by run_hypercube.m


Command:
run_hypercube_bear([0.1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [10,100,1000,1000,1], [1:3, 5:6], [2],[4], 4*1024^2, 'double', 'control1');


This was renamed to *_original* and then I copied this latin hypercube 4 times with parameter 4 (m in the model an integer) equals to 1,2,3,4.

That is what is contained in par_choices_acth_double.mat.

This allows searching through various integer values of m

The final version has 16*1024^2 points consistent with other simulations,
but it has all 6 parameters that are not fixed.
